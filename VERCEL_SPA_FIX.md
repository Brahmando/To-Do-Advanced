# Vercel SPA Deployment Fix

## Problem
When reloading pages on Vercel (like `/groups`, `/my-tasks`, etc.), you were getting a 404 error because Vercel was trying to find physical files at those paths, but they're client-side routes handled by React Router.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created `vercel.json` Configuration
Added a `vercel.json` file in the frontend root directory with:
- **Rewrites**: All routes (`/*`) redirect to `/index.html` to enable SPA routing
- **Headers**: Security headers and cache control
- **trailingSlash**: Set to false for consistency

### 2. Added Catch-all Route
Enhanced React Router configuration in `App.jsx`:
- Added `<Route path="*" element={<Navigate to="/" replace />} />` to handle any unmatched routes

### 3. Existing Good Practices Confirmed
- ✅ BrowserRouter is properly configured
- ✅ Authentication state restoration from localStorage works
- ✅ Vite config has `historyApiFallback: true` for development
- ✅ User state is properly managed across page reloads

## How It Works

1. **User visits any URL** (e.g., `yoursite.vercel.app/my-tasks`)
2. **Vercel receives request** and applies the rewrite rule
3. **Serves index.html** instead of looking for a physical file
4. **React app loads** and React Router takes over
5. **Correct component renders** based on the URL path
6. **User authentication state** is restored from localStorage
7. **Page displays correctly** with all user data

## Files Modified

1. `/To-Do-Frontend/vercel.json` - **CREATED**
2. `/To-Do-Frontend/src/App.jsx` - Added catch-all route
3. `/To-Do-Frontend/public/_redirects` - Added Netlify comment

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Commit all changes** to your repository
2. **Push to main branch**
3. **Vercel will auto-deploy** (if connected to GitHub)
4. **Test the fix** by:
   - Visiting your live site
   - Navigating to different pages
   - Refreshing the browser on each page
   - Checking that authentication state persists

## Expected Results

- ✅ Page reloads work on all routes
- ✅ User stays logged in after refresh
- ✅ All data loads correctly
- ✅ No more 404 errors
- ✅ Direct URL access works (e.g., sharing links)

## Troubleshooting

If you still see issues:
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Check Vercel deployment logs
3. Verify environment variables are set correctly
4. Ensure API endpoints are accessible from the frontend domain

The fix should resolve the 404 NOT_FOUND error you were experiencing on page reloads.
