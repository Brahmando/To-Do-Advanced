# Bug Fixes and Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. 404 Error on Page Reload (SPA Routing Issue)

**Problem**: When reloading any page other than the home page, users got a 404 error.

**Solution**:
- Added `historyApiFallback: true` to `vite.config.js` for development server
- Created `public/_redirects` file with `/*    /index.html   200` for production deployment
- Added proper preview configuration in Vite config

**Files Modified**:
- `vite.config.js` - Added SPA routing support
- `public/_redirects` - Created for production deployment

### 2. Group Chat Mobile Responsiveness

**Problem**: Group chat was not responsive on mobile devices, with fixed widths and poor mobile UX.

**Solution**:
- Completely rewrote GroupChat component with mobile-first responsive design
- Added responsive sizing using Tailwind classes: `w-80 sm:w-96 md:w-[400px] lg:w-[450px]`
- Implemented mobile-specific adjustments: `max-w-[calc(100vw-2rem)]` and `max-h-[calc(100vh-8rem)]`
- Improved touch targets with proper sizing for mobile devices
- Added responsive text sizes and spacing
- Hidden emoji picker on very small screens to save space
- Improved message bubble layout for mobile viewing

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/GroupChat.jsx` - Completely rewritten with mobile responsiveness

- `src/styles/mobile.css` - Added mobile-specific CSS improvements

### 3. AI Assistant Not Showing Updated Results

**Problem**: After adding new tasks, the AI assistant still showed old data and didn't reflect recent changes.

**Solution**:
- Added automatic cache invalidation when tasks are created, completed, or deleted
- Created a new `/api/ai-chatbot/refresh-cache` endpoint to manually refresh data
- Modified TaskBuddyChat component to refresh user data when chat opens
- Added manual refresh button in the AI chat interface
- Updated task controllers to automatically clear user cache after task operations

**Files Modified**:

- `To-Do-Backend/routes/aiChatbot.js` - Added refresh cache endpoint
- `To-Do-Backend/services/cacheService.js` - Added clearUserCache function
- `To-Do-Backend/controllers/tasksController.js` - Added automatic cache clearing
