there has to be many changes.
1. there has to be undo(when its completed)and edit  option  for  tasks inside  Group Task and the delete option has to be removed for tasks under groups. delete for whole groups are okay.And same for tasks under shared groups also. groups in groups task and shared groups are same. group task belong to the user and shared is shared. u can make all feature of groups same for groups whether in group task or shared.
2. the notification button has to be moved to right side of Group Task tab in nav bar.
3. in the date & clock time field ,when i try erase the default data/time to enter my desired value,a automatic zero(0) appears which is annoying and i cant enter desired values properly.i should be able to erase all values prorperly then enter my values.fix that too pls.
4. when user clicks on complete in groups task after its enabled,a pop up confirmation should appear mentioning clearly and professionaly that once its marked completed cant be undo.does he accept.and same for warning confirmation for Group Tasks' groups too when use tries complete.
5. there is no delete button for groups in Shared groups. So create a delete button there and when owner and only the owner clicks delete , a custome pop up should appear which clearly mentions professionaly that you are going delete the group. are you sure? only should have delete access for shared groups. same for groups in Group Tasks too.
6. when user share his/her personal groups from Group Tasks, the group appears in Shared Groups but its task whether active or completed does not show up there. fix that too pls.
7. u have used deprecated react-beautiful-dnd which is not working too in the project, instead use dnd-kit, remove any leftover related to react-beautiful-dnd and make the project work properly.
8. in shared group's group details page, number of member shows but name of members does not. clicking that should open a  list of members at the side. and also owner should have proper power to remove or change permission access for members. that should be exceuted properly in the app
9. u have made group tasks as block in Group Tasks tab which is good but i want it to be horizoantal as it was before with dropdown showing the tasks as it shows in group task section in home page too. also both places whether its group task section in home page or in Group Task tab/the pop up page, all the features like edit,undo,complete ,delete all options should be available.
10. every user should get notifications for all possible reasons like request acceptance or rejection or even pending properly and professionaly.also when user apply for coolaborator or medium access and waits for owner approval, user should see pending status for the request propely.
11. remember the permissions of access i mentioned before, there should no loopholes at all.
12. i checked for private group,the credentials not working when trying joining. pls check that precisely,maybe any property issue or something. fix it properly pls.
13. one more imp thing, i want to add a serach bar which should efficiently search all task across normal task, group tasks or shared tasks and the sorting list should  appear live, below the search  bar in beautiful list with each search input. just whatever tasks appear in the list,if it is under group task  or shared should be mention aside with its status. and also groups can also be searched there and if any reasults appear in the list should mention if its is under group Task or shared task with its status. also there should be 3 filters to search also alongside 'All'. They are 1. All  2.Groups 3. Tasks
14. Also sometimes i see, when deleting the tasks in shared ,when clicking delete tasks,it maybe deleting backend but its still shows so when thinking that its not working click on delete multiple times,in the change log also it shows that task has been deleted multiple times which is wrong.once clicked on delete,the operation has to be finished then only another click op will be taken and and same for all in the project if same issue might arise for any other. fix that too
15. There has to be a delete section deleted tasks in shared groups where all can see what tasks has been done past and deleted.
