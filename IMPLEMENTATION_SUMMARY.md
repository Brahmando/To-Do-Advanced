2. User checks email → **Receives beautiful OTP email**
3. User enters OTP → **Account verified & activated**
4. User receives welcome email → **Can now login**

### Login Process:
1. User enters credentials → **System checks verification status**
2. If unverified → **Redirected to OTP verification**
3. If verified → **Normal login process**

   ```

2. **Gmail Setup:**
